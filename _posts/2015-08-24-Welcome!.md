**MCQB** is an artistic project maintained by [Ennio](http://enniofranco.com) e [FÃ¡bio](http://fabiosasseron.com). We intend to create images, animations, videos and any other colourful and fun revelries.  

### Our chosen path
We'll take the exercises and examples in the book *[Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com)* as a starting point. Its author, Daniel Shiffman, has generously provided  both the book [code](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples) and  [videos](https://vimeo.com/channels/natureofcode) free of charge.

If you're curious about us, check our [About](http://whysasse.github.io/about/) page.
